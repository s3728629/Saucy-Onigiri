        <h2 id="subheading-text">Compromise and Expectations</h1>
            Below are the potential obstacles we may face as a group and solutions to those issues that may arise
            during the duration of creating the project.
        <p id= "subsubheading-text">Potential Issues</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Members not being able to attend a meeting unexpectedly due to blank reason.
            </li>
            <li>Work not being completed by the due date.
                Inconsistent communication and absence, leading to disorganisation and clashing.
            </li>
            <li>Unpleasant behaviour that leads to an uncompromising environment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id= "subsubheading-text">Prevention and Compromise</p>
        <p>To avoid these issues above, we need to:</p>
        Stay Conistently Organised:
        <ul>
            <li>This includes members to attend on their own or follow the groups schedule consistently and setting
                 reminders that will enable our group to stay up to date.
            </li>
            <li>If members were not able to meet the goal of completing work at the preferred due date, then they must
                 meet the final due date. This is done just in case the completion of work is not finished by the preferred time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Concise Communication and Appropriate Behaviour at Work:
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying a honest, open minded and to encourage a diversity of opinions when approaching each other will prevent a clashing environment.
            </li>
            <li>Having an environment that includes everyone's suggestions into consideration and having a reasonable mindset within all communication between the group will result in a more productive workflow.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p id= "subsubheading-text">Peer Feedback Method</p>
        We will:
        <ul>
            <li>Participate within our meetings in a professional, cooperative and active manner.</li>
            <li>Have all members proofread each other's work to provide frequent feedback and encourage improvements.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 id="subheading-text">Communication</h1>
        <p>The required communication platform the group will be using is Microsoft Teams. The main source of expected frequency of responses are located in the team is called, ‘Saucy Onigiri’
            (TR-WE-230-Saucy-Onigiri). These meetings will include face to face verbal communication. Along with using Google Documents to share our content work to provide live visual feedback and cooperation.
        </p>
        Team Meeting Rules:
        <ul>
            <li>Attend all meetings within the duration of 1 hour each. As well as working approximately 6 hours a week.</li>
            <li>Acknowledge that every individual member within the group, will contribute fair efforts of work and provide our individual opinions/ suggestions for the group project.</li>
            <li>Actively communicating on Microsoft Teams in order to avoid miscommunication and enhance organisation.</li>
            <li>Use Github to record my progress on a frequent basis and use Trello as a result of a more organised workflow.</li>
            <li>Possess a computer or laptop and a diligent mindset in preparation for each meeting.</li>
            <li>Will be in agreement to attend meetings two or three times a week.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 id="subheading-text">Tools</h1>
        <p>The weekly workflow for the project requires each group member to use Github and Trello. Each member needs to contribute and/or share their work within the groups Github repository.
            Inserting and sharing the code within Github is the main purpose of using it, in order to share code with the corresponding members. On the other hand, Trello is essential for staying organised,
            accommodating to due dates. The platform will have members being aware of what tasks are being done by who, what has already been completed and knowing what each member needs to accomplish
            before the deadline.
