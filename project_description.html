  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <h3>What is Stay Connected?</h3>
  <p>The main premise behind the Stay Connected project is the creation of an accessibility focused website that will cater to the older and less technologically experienced portion of the community, that are lacking social connection with family and friends in their daily lives. What the project aims to do is provide a hub which the targeted audience can learn how to use technology to communicate and operate their devices, in particular, areas such as using social media applications, creating and sending emails, and navigating/operating their own device.</p>
  <p>The website plans to include step by step tutorials on how to use features of the main communication apps for the aforementioned demographic. This will be easy for users to easily follow along with their own device and will include features such as speed control settings, volume control, full-screen mode, captions in a variety of languages, forward/reverse skip and also assistant with these features. We aim to make the interface of the website as simple as possible to ensure our users are comfortable and can easily navigate the website with as little prior skill required. We are also developing ‘guide print out’ (printable instructions) on how to use some tech features for those that like to learn from paper. This is also a goal of ours as we are aware that some users may prefer physical instructions to fully understand the content. These guides will include step by step instructions and are available in multiple languages to aid users of the older demographic that personally prefer reading and following instructions in physical form.</p>
  <p>The website will also have interactive media that allows the user to be ‘tested’ with the knowledge they have just learned from a video and implement skills they have learned from the tutorials. This helps to reinforce the knowledge they have just learned and apply those skills. A quiz will also be available for users when they first use the website to understand their level of technological capability and recommend tutorials that best suit them.</p>
  <p>A live chat box feature is also a potential goal of ours as it can help users with any issues or questions they have immediately. It can also help to gather data on what issues or queries are the most recurring so that we can take measures to constantly improve. A text to speech and speech to text feature is also planned to be developed as it will ensure senior users will not strain their vision and can easily access the information. It is aimed to be implemented to the live bot. The priority features include the tutorials and the printable instructions as they are the main features of the site and contain the bulk of information for the users. A limitation may be that the ‘quiz’ cannot be developed in time as it requires time and skill to develop. We plan to replace that feature with pictures or screenshots of the app or program features we are demonstrating as a summary that is easy to refer to should we run out of time.</p>
  <h3>Our Motivation</h3>
  <h4>Why did we choose this project?</h4>
  <p>Our website will be very useful and we feel it is a very important tool given the current environment in terms of communication. The world is in crisis and now more than ever we need to rely on the trend of technology to communicate. There are millions of people that have not been able to keep up with the rest of the world in regard to technological advances, even though they were surrounded by it with friends and family. Now with social distancing and everyone being instructed to stay at home there will be many that cannot get their help from those they know and the only help is with the use of technical functions, hence they won’t actually have any assistance at all. We as a society have left people behind, and now for some, it is too late as they now are in full isolation and unable to have people to communicate with face to face. If only we had encouraged and even pushed people to all be connected. This is why we feel motivated to have a website that can easily illustrate how to use their devices to communicate and keep them socially connected while in times like now. This demonstrates our understanding of the current situation and that we want to make a difference to help people to connect with others virtually. We are motivated because we want the older generation to get familiar and be comfortable with using the technology that we use in our daily life. 
  </p>
  <h4>How does this project relate to us?</h4>
  <p>This project has inspired us to help those who are alone during our current worldwide pandemic and are unable to communicate with their friends and family. This also relates to the fact that the majority of us (Jessani, Dylan, Anisah, Yumi and Jade) have an interest in web development and feel that we will be able to successfully bring this prototype to life. We all know someone who needs this website and that is another reason why we feel that it will help people and why we are interested in this project.
  </p>
  <h4>What IT skills will need to be enhanced to complete this project?</h4>
  <p>We are very fortunate that our project is a website and we are lucky to have had some web experience last semester in Introduction to IT and we are all studying web programming this semester side by side with this project. We feel that we will be able to accomplish most of our project with the skills we already have. However, we still need to improve our web programming skills to achieve all of our features within our website. In particular, we will need to learn how to program the video feature: add subtitles, forward/reverse button, how to make the video(creating it), how to code a chat-box feature, translating (mostly), how to add and download pdf, how to change font size and how to code a search bar. So some skills we will need to require are javascript, more HTML, CSS.
  </p>
  <h4>From Introduction to IT, how did this idea evolve into the current project with the feedback received?</h4>
  <p>This is an idea from what we had in Introduction to IT and the only area of improvement from our assignment last semester was our timeframe with having a UI design and prototype earlier on, although there were no comments on improving our project idea. We feel quite strongly that our project idea has evolved enough for us to create and feel confident in achieving, so we will not be altering much. However, with the time and skills, we decided to remove the features of translating the whole page, providing audio for the descriptions and more, aimed towards people with disabilities as it was too broad (suggested from a tutor).

  <h3>Demonstrable Outcomes</h3>
  <h4>Features</h4>
  <d1>
    <dt>Quiz</dt>
    <dd>The user would first be welcomed by a quiz that tailors to their needs regarding the website. It would contain questions such as the type of device needed for communication, preferred font size and language. These questions ensure a suitable website for the user to learn from.</dd><br>
    <dt>Tutorials</dt>
    <dd>The website will then showcase tutorials once the user has completed the quiz. These tutorials will aim to educate the user regarding the different methods one can communicate with their device. It will be presented in a simple and precise format which allows the user to follow a step by step process with ease.</dd><br>
    <dt>Videos</dt>
    <dd>Furthermore, the tutorials highlight methods needed to facetime, use Whatsapp, messenger, emailing, making calls and such. It will contain videos with audio that enables the user to adjust depending on their liking. Functions that can be changeable are the speed or volume of the video.</dd><br>
    <dt>Chatbox</dt>
    <dd>Another feature of this website is the implementation of a chatbot. This enables the user to ask the bot questions if they require additional assistance. Questions that are likely to pop up help regarding the navigation of the website, how to follow instructions of the tutorials and such. </dd><br>
    <dt>Print-out Guide</dt>
    <dd>If the videos on the tutorials are still unclear, users are able to print out the step by step processes in their preferred language. This feature appeals to those who prefer to read, rather than follow a video for instructions. </dd>
  </d1>
  <h4>Extended Features</h4>
  <d1>
    <dt>Additional Quiz</dt>
    <dd>After the user has gone through the tutorials, an additional quiz will be displayed to test their knowledge. This quiz aims to check if the users understood the instructions given in the videos. Once the quiz has been completed, users are able to seek additional help if they are still unclear. </dd><br>
    <dt>Search Bar</dt>
    <dd>If the users already have in mind a specific tutorial, they wouldn’t need to complete the quiz at the start of the website but rather just type up their desired tutorial through the search bar. This enables the user to be time-efficient as this method eliminates unnecessary steps to the user. </dd><br>
    <dt>Filter Option for Tutorials</dt>
    <dd>Once the quiz has been generated, many tutorials will appear. By having a filter present, users are able to utilise the filter button to sort out the different tutorials listed. This will make it easier for the users to seek for a specific set of instructions regarding their mobile device.</dd><br>
  </d1>
  <h3>Understanding our Target</h3>
  <h4>Competitor</h4>
  <p>A competitor/similar system is Be Connected By The Australian Government:<br>
    This website is aimed at seniors and has similar functions to what we are planning to achieve. The difference is this website’s purpose is to teach people how to use their devices, such as setting up, privacy, connecting to Wi-Fi and etc. rather than teaching how to use their devices to communicate. On this website they do have a section about skype, facetime, etc. however it is not explained as well as their courses for teaching using devices. Differently, we plan on giving a very short quiz at the start to know what kind of device the user is using to view our website and what size font they would like to view our website in. We would also like our teaching to be more interactive to get the user more involved to really understand what they are learning. Furthermore, we would like to teach through videos, and before the video, there would be optional instructions to explain how to use the video feature such as volume, speed, backward/forward button, screen size. As well we would like our website to have subtitles available in different languages for the videos as well as for the print copies of the guide.
    </p>
    <br>
  <p>We also conducted an interview to further fully understand our target group which we are creating our project for.</p>
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w_8IT8yHmJoyIlWEOxJt5JX0P4zLANlX63zGnJiq2aI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click here for interview questions and results.</a>
  <br>
  <p>From these interviews, we discovered that our target group only has the most basic knowledge of using communication technology applications. Thus they only use the application’s basic features such as calling and messaging. Another key reason that plays into their choice for using that certain application is whether their friends and family are using it. </p>
  <p>Some of our interviewees also stated that most times that they have to learn how to use basic features of certain applications, if not taught then they would have trouble using that feature. If they don’t know how to use a certain feature, they would either learn or not use it at all.</p>
  <p>It was also shown that most people showed interest in learning how to use certain features and preferred to learn from videos. It was also implied that it’s important for our website to be simple to use so users are actually able to use it. Most of our interviewee showed interest in using a chatbox and would appreciate that feature.</p>
