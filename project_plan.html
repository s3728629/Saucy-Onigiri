  <h4>Proposal (Week 1-4)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Docs</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Will be used to organise a proposal for assignment 1.</li>
            <li>We chose to use this tool because it’s easy for other group members to collaborate together.
            </li>
            <li>$0</li>
            <li>Microsoft office ( <a href="www.office.com" target="_blank">www.office.com</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Trello</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Tasks can be created and managed in the kanban list style. </li>
            <li>We chose this tool because all members can access the list and keep each other organised with setting deadlines for tasks. It also helps keep the group on one page and the same track hence why we chose to use it.
            </li>
            <li>$0</li>
            <li>Asana ( <a href="www.asana.com" target="_blank">www.asana.com</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Github</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Will be used to create a website using HTML and CSS containing our proposal.
            </li>
            <li>We chose this tool because Github allows each member to edit the HTML and CSS code, making it easier for team members to collaborate on coding. 
            </li>
            <li>$0</li>
            <li>GitLab ( <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">https://about.gitlab.com/</a></li>

        <ul>
            <li>Used to host meetings.
            </li>
            <li>We choose Microsoft Teams because it contains all the features we need to communicate with team members such as video call, messaging and file sharing.</li>

            <li>Will be used to host our website</li>
            <li>We are using AWS because all team members are familiar with it and find it easy to use.

        <ul>
            <li>Used to design the prototype of our web pages.</li>

 <h3>Beyong Current</h3>
 Capabilities<br>
 <p>The idea of the project is to extend your individual current IT knowledge. 
    In this section you will explain what your current knowledge is and how completion of the project will extend it. In particular, we are looking to see how someone who might consider coding to not be 
    their best skill, to use this project to improve their coding skills. If you are honest, this project will be of great benefit to your IT development. It’s important that each group member tries to move out of their current “comfort zone”. 
    </p>
    <p>All members in our group are first year IT students, meaning that our skills aren’t as refined as the industry standard. However, we each have our strengths and weaknesses that balance out our 
        capabilities in the team.  A number of our team members, - Jessani, Jade, Akeela, Yumi and Anisah - are strong in design and ux related areas and weaker at web programming with the exception of 
        Jade and Jessani who are comfortable with coding in HTML. Dylan’s strength lies in Github, web programming and networking and his area to develop is design. Therefore pairing him with a more design oriented 
        team member with weaker programming skills ensure that both can support each other and develop their skills. We have 3 strong web programmers and 3 strong designers, so pairing up will work well. We took all of 
        this into consideration when assigning the roles, and ensured that everyone gets a chance to develop their skills in an area they feel needs work on. Since our project is a website, it's a perfect opportunity to develop 
        our HTML coding and UX design skills to ensure our website is as smooth running and simple to use as possible. 
    </p>
    <h3>Project Risks</h3>
    <p>Since Australia is such a diverse country, it will be a challenge to translate into every single language spoken here for each of our videos’ closed captions so we will likely use google translate
         or other reliable auto-translate technologies to make it as accessible as possible. However, we could always push that back and add translation as an update later on if it takes too long to develop
          and will delay the launch of our product. Another challenge will be the AI chatbot. As a team, we do not have the necessary skills and experience in developing such a complex feature so we will need
           to work on developing our skills for it. Having such an intricate feature, it’s vital that our website can support it without crashing or causing any errors. During the project, we will test it, however, 
           there can always be errors we did not pick up on.  Another possible challenge will be the quiz. We assigned two strong web programmers to take charge in developing that feature as it is something none of us 
           have much experience with. We may not be able to complete a comprehensive enough quiz that covers the content with a simple interface. Additionally, coding a quiz that can correct answers and suggest a relevant point of reference for an incorrect answer will be a challenge so we aim to do as much research and consult industry persons with experience in this area that can guide us.
